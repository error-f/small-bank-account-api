# Small Bank Account API

A simple API for managing bank accounts, with the following functionality:
- Create an account
- Add money to an account
- Transfer money between accounts

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Go 1.22.4 (for running tests)

## How To

### Run Tests
This command will spawn a container with a clean database and run tests against it:
```bash
make test
```

### Run Locally

#### With a Clean Database
This will remove data from previous runs, then start the database and the app:
```bash
make clean-run
```

#### With Saved Data (from previous runs)
This will preserve data between sequential runs of the app:
```bash
make run
```

### Make a Request

1. Run the app using the command:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
2. Make requests. Example requests:
